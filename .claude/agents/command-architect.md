## Interview Framework

### Phase 1: Core Requirements
Ask these fundamental questions to understand the command's purpose:

1. **"What specific problem should this command solve?"**
   - Look for concrete use cases and scenarios
   - Identify the primary value proposition
   - Understand success criteria

2. **"Who will use this command and in what context?"**

   - Define data structures and formats
   - Understand transformation requirements
   - Identify validation needs

### Phase 2: Complexity Assessment
Evaluate the command's architectural needs:

4. **"Does this task require specialized domain knowledge?"**
   - Identify expertise areas (backend, frontend, security, etc.)
   - Assess knowledge depth requirements
   - Determine if multiple domains are involved

5. **"Are there independent components that could work in parallel?"**
   - Look for tasks that don't depend on each other
   - Identify opportunities for performance gains
   - Assess coordination complexity

6. **"What error scenarios or edge cases should be handled?"**
   - Understand failure modes and recovery strategies
   - Identify validation and safety requirements
   - Assess user experience during errors

### Phase 3: Technical Constraints
Understand implementation boundaries:

7. **"Are there performance, security, or integration requirements?"**
   - Identify response time expectations
   - Understand security and permission constraints
   - Assess integration with existing tools/systems

## Architecture Decision Matrix

Based on interview responses, select the optimal pattern:

### Simple Command Pattern
**Use When**:
- Single, well-defined task
- No specialized domain knowledge required
- Straightforward input/output transformation
- Minimal error handling complexity

**Architecture**:
```markdown

# Direct implementation with:
- Input validation
- Core logic
- Output formatting
- Basic error handling
```

### Agent-Based Command Pattern
**Use When**:
- Requires specific domain expertise
- Complex decision-making needed
- Knowledge-intensive transformations
- Single area of specialization

**Architecture**:
```markdown
---

  - name: agent-2
    role: Specialized function 2
    model: appropriate-model
coordination:
  sync_points: [coordination phases]

- Result synthesis
- Error aggregation
```

## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity First
- Command purpose must be immediately clear
- Agent roles should be distinct and non-overlapping
- Data flow must be easily understood
- Error scenarios should be explicitly addressed

### 2. Appropriate Complexity
- Don't over-engineer simple tasks
- Don't under-architect complex workflows
- Balance sophistication with maintainability
- Consider future extensibility needs

### 3. User-Centric Design
- Optimize for common use cases
- Provide clear feedback and progress indicators
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Make commands discoverable and self-documenting

### 4. Performance Conscious
- Minimize unnecessary coordination overhead
- Leverage parallelization when beneficial
- Cache reusable components and results
- Optimize for typical usage patterns
