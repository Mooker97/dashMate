## 1. Build and Bundle Analysis

### Current Bundle Characteristics

**Primary Bundles:**
- **Main App Bundle**: `main-app.js` - 7,586,539 bytes (7.59MB)
- **Main Bundle**: `main.js` - 6,734,692 bytes (6.73MB)
- **Largest Chunk**: `60b477e959a3b8fb.js` - 474,150 bytes (474KB)
- **Total Build Output**: ~16MB across all chunks

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Excessive Bundle Size**: 
   - Main bundles exceed recommended thresholds for mobile users
   - ADHD users require sub-200ms initial load for maintaining focus
   - Current size likely causes 3-5 second initial load times on 3G connections

2. **Monolithic Bundle Structure**:
   - All components loaded upfront regardless of usage
   - Heavy dependencies (Framer Motion, Supabase, OpenAI) bundled together
   - Missing strategic code splitting for modal components

3. **Development Build Issues**:
   - Routes manifest errors indicating build configuration problems
   - 159.4s initial compilation time severely impacts developer productivity
   - Hot reload potentially affected by bundle complexity

### Dependency Impact Analysis

**High-Impact Dependencies:**
- `framer-motion` (12.23.12): Animation library adding ~100KB+ to bundle
- `@supabase/supabase-js` (2.57.2): Database client adding ~200KB+
- `openai` (5.19.1): AI SDK adding ~150KB+
- `lucide-react` (0.542.0): Icon library potentially loading unused icons

**Framework Stack Efficiency:**
- Next.js 15.5.2 with Turbopack: Good choice for performance
- React 19.1.0: Latest version with optimizations
- Tailwind CSS 4.0: Efficient utility-first approach

## 2. Runtime Performance Assessment

### Current Performance Characteristics

**Compilation Metrics:**
- Initial page compilation: 10.1s (1,803 modules)
- Error page compilation: 2.2s (2,112 modules)
- Favicon compilation: 249ms (1,147 modules)
- Incremental compilation: 491ms (982 modules)

**Component Performance Patterns:**

1. **MicrophoneButton Component**:
   - ✅ Efficient use of `useRef` for MediaRecorder management
   - ✅ Proper cleanup in useEffect for memory management
   - ✅ Real-time audio level analysis with requestAnimationFrame
   - ⚠️ Multiple Framer Motion animations may impact frame rate

2. **Task Management (useTasks Hook)**:
   - ✅ Smart dual-mode (local/Supabase) data persistence
   - ✅ Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
   - ⚠️ No memoization for expensive operations
   - ⚠️ Potential N+1 queries for bulk task operations

3. **Main Page Component**:
   - ⚠️ Large component with 500+ lines, impacts code splitting
   - ⚠️ Multiple modal states causing re-renders
   - ⚠️ Heavy dependency on context and multiple hooks

### Memory Usage Patterns

**Potential Memory Concerns:**
- Audio processing in MicrophoneButton creates temporary blobs
- Large productivity coach singleton with behavior history caching
- Framer Motion animations creating multiple DOM nodes
- Multiple WebAPI instances (AudioContext, MediaRecorder) without pooling
