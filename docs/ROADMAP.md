## Q2 2025 - Infrastructure & Scalability

### Full Auth & Database Architecture with tRPC

**Timeline**: Q2 2025  
**Status**: Planned  
**Priority**: High - Foundation for future feature development  
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium (existing database infrastructure reduces risk)

#### Business Value
Transform dashMate from local-only to a scalable, type-safe, cloud-first architecture that provides:
- Seamless cross-device task synchronization for ADHD users
- Enhanced reliability and data persistence 
- Foundation for advanced AI coaching features
- Improved developer experience and feature velocity

#### Technical Approach
**Architecture**: Database ’ Service Layer ’ tRPC API ’ Frontend

**Implementation Stack:**
- **Database**: Existing Supabase/PostgreSQL (already implemented)
- **Service Layer**: Extract business logic from React hooks into repository pattern
- **API Layer**: tRPC with Zod validation for type-safe client-server communication
- **Frontend**: Refactored React hooks using tRPC client with optimistic updates

#### Resource Requirements
- **Team**: 1 Senior Full-Stack Developer + 1 Mid-Level Developer
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (detailed breakdown in tech analysis)
- **Skills Required**: tRPC expertise, repository pattern, API design
- **Effort**: Medium-High complexity

#### Dependencies
- Team tRPC training (Q1 preparation)
- Enhanced monitoring setup
- API versioning strategy
- Performance baseline establishment

#### Success Metrics
- 100% type safety across API boundaries
- <100ms latency for 95% of API calls
- Zero breaking changes for existing functionality
- 40% reduction in new feature integration time
- Maintain ADHD-friendly performance characteristics

#### Implementation Phases
1. **Week 1**: Foundation layer and service extraction
2. **Week 2**: Core tRPC implementation and frontend integration
3. **Week 3**: Testing, optimization, and error handling
4. **Week 4**: Documentation, deployment, and monitoring

#### Strategic Impact
- Enables advanced AI coaching integration
- Supports future mobile app development
- Improves scalability for multi-user features
