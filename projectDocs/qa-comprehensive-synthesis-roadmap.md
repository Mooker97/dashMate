## 1. Cross-Stream Correlation Analysis

### Performance-UX Impact Correlations

**Critical Finding: Performance Threatens UX Excellence**
- **7.59MB bundle size** directly undermines the excellent ADHD-friendly design
- **3.5-5.2s initial load time** exceeds attention span thresholds for ADHD users
- **528-line main component** impacts both code maintainability and runtime performance
- **Missing code splitting** prevents progressive loading of the sophisticated UI features

**ADHD-Specific Performance Requirements:**
- **< 1.5s initial load** required to maintain attention span
- **< 100ms interaction response** essential for immediate feedback patterns
- **Consistent performance** needed to support cognitive load management

### Code Quality-Accessibility Integration

**Positive Correlations:**
- **Excellent TypeScript implementation (8.2/10)** strongly supports accessibility features
- **Sophisticated ADHD-specific type definitions** enable type-safe accessibility patterns
- **Clean component hierarchy** facilitates screen reader navigation

**Critical Gaps:**
- **Missing testing infrastructure (5.8/10)** creates risk for accessibility regressions
- **Component size issues** make accessibility features harder to maintain
- **Type duplication** could lead to inconsistent accessibility implementations

### Performance-Code Architecture Integration

**Architectural Strengths Supporting Performance:**
